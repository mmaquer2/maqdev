   <main> <p> Hello! My name is Michael Maquera I am a aspiring Web Developer based in Nashville, TN. I am a programmer with experience in
        Javascript, Python, and Matlab. In 2016 I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Neuroscience from George Mason University. Previously, I have served as an Infantry Officer in the United States Army, worked
        as a Policy Analyst in Washington DC, and a Bioengineering Laboratory Assistant. In my free time I enjoy watching motorsports, running, and watching Washington Capitals Hockey. I am always looking for
        challenging new oppurtunities.

    <center><h1> My Story</h1></center>
   
    <p>
            In May of 2016 I graduated from George Mason University where I completed a double major degree in neuroscience and psychology. Upon graduation I also received an active duty commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in the United States Army through George Mason University’s Army ROTC program. Prior to attending basic training, I worked as a research assistant at George Mason University’s Neural Engineering laboratory and as a Policy Analyst at Systems Planning and Analysis, a defense contractor in the Washington DC area. 
            My previous work experience includes eighteen months of research work at the Neural Engineering Laboratory at George Mason University. The lab’s focus was the use of in vitro neuronal cultures through the multi electrode array platform to examine neural network activity. I have assisted in projects related to optogenetic stimulation, selective adaptation, long term potentiation, and long-term depression. Also, while working as a policy analyst at Systems Planning and Analysis for four months. I assisted in projects related to creating software tools to analyze and address technology gaps in the Department of Defenses’ research and development budget. 
            For the previous two years I have served as an Infantry Officer at Fort Campbell, KY. Working as a maintenance control officer and a rifle platoon leader.
            Additionally, my undergraduate coursework, work experience, and personal hobbies has given myself a basic understanding of programming in Python, Matlab, and Javascript languages. My main goal is to embrace the mindset of lifelong learning and see what new oppurtunities programming brings me.
